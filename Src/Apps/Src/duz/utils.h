/*! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * @brief This function will continuously read the system status register until it matches the bits set in the mask
 *        input parameter. It will then exit the function.
 *        This is useful to use when waiting on particular events to occurs. For example, the user could wait for a
 *        good UWB frame to be received and/or no receive errors have occurred.
 *        The lower 32-bits of the system status register will be read in a while loop. Each iteration of the loop will check if a matching
 *        mask value for the higher 32-bits of the system status register is set. If the mask value is set in the higher 32-bits of the system
 *        status register, the function will return that value along with the last recorded value of the lower 32-bits of the system status
 *        register. Thus, the user should be aware that this function will not wait for high and low mask values to be set in both the low and high
 *        system status registers. Alternatively, the user can call this function to *only* check the higher or lower system status registers.
 *
 * input parameters
 * @param lo_result - A pointer to a uint32_t that will contain the final value of the system status register (lower 32 bits).
 *                    Pass in a NULL pointer to ignore returning this value.
 * @param hi_result - A pointer to a uint32_t that will contain the final value of the system status register (higher 32 bits).
 *                    Pass in a NULL pointer to ignore returning this value.
 * @param lo_mask - a uint32 mask value that is used to check for certain bits to be set in the system status register (lower 32 bits).
 *               Example values to use are as follows:
 *               DWT_INT_TXFRS_BIT_MASK - Wait for a TX frame to be sent.
 *               SYS_STATUS_RXFCG_BIT_MASK | SYS_STATUS_ALL_RX_ERR - Wait for frame to be received and no reception errors.
 *               SYS_STATUS_RXFCG_BIT_MASK | SYS_STATUS_ALL_RX_TO | SYS_STATUS_ALL_RX_ERR - Wait for frame to be received and no receive timeout errors
 *                                                                                          and no reception errors.
 *               SYS_STATUS_RXFR_BIT_MASK | SYS_STATUS_ALL_RX_TO | SYS_STATUS_ALL_ND_RX_ERR - Wait for packet to be received and no receive timeout errors
 *                                                                                            and no reception errors.
 *                                                                                            These flags are useful when polling for STS Mode 3 (no data)
 *                                                                                            packets.
 *               0 - The function will not wait for any bits in the system status register (lower 32 bits).
 * @param hi_mask - a uint32 mask value that is used to check for certain bits to be set in the system status register (higher 32 bits).
 *               Example values to use are as follows:
 *               SYS_STATUS_HI_CCA_FAIL_BIT_MASK - Check for CCA fail status.
 *               0 - The function will not wait for any bits in the system status register (lower 32 bits).
 *
 * return None
